This directory contains indeo4 related files for FFmpeg.

The attached decoder is able to decode only key frames at this moment.
It will be extended step by step to support all necessary coding modes.

PLEASE NOTE: in order to be able to run this decoder some patching of the
existing FFmpeg code for indeo5 is required! I'll send all needed patches
as soon I tested them...

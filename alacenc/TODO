TODO list for the ALAC Encoder:

* GSoC feature set is complete

Additonal Stuff:

* Testing against I-Pod/I-tunes/Quicktime/<your favorite Apple proprietary product here> for compatibility
* Support for varying compression levels
* Benchmark against other popular lossless codecs
* Benchmark against iTunes and dBpoweramp ALAC encoders

Experiments:

* Adaptive stereo decorrelation
* Adaptive Rice History based encoding
* Estimate size of entropy coded data for faster prediction order search
* Test different LPC coeff quantization levels
* < Other creative ideas go here >

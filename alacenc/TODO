TODO list for the ALAC Encoder:

* Implement basic ALAC entropy coding
* Simple first-order linear prediction
* Adaptive prediction

Additonal Stuff:

* Testing against I-Pod/I-tunes/Quicktime/<your favorite Apple proprietary product here> for compatibility
* Support for varying compression levels
* Benchmark against other popular lossless codecs

Experiments:

* Adaptive Rice History based encoding
* < Other creative ideas go here >

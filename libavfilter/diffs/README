These diff files, applied in sequence, will allow ffplay to use libavfilter:

00_build.diff:
    build system changes

01_ffplay_get_video_frame.diff:
    separate a function to get the next video frame out from the main video
    thread function.  this will make it easier to replace it with a version
    which returns the frame after being filtered.

02_ffplay_VideoPicture_vars.diff:
    changes the code to use the image dimensions and pixel format stored in
    the VideoPicture structure, rather than assuming the codec is right.  if
    we filter the video, the codec may not accurately represent the filtered
    output.

03_ffplay_filters.diff:
    enables filtering

FRAMEWORK:
- can colorspace negotiation be improved?
- auto-inserting needed filters (colorspace conversion, buffer, etc)
- parameter passing (can this be done better with AVOption?)
- pass pts, and whatever info is needed to reorder decode ordered frames
- other useful image flags?  interlace?  top/bottom field first?
- ease reuse of same memory for multiple slices

- proper vout filter support, with a display() callback?
- support for running different filters in different threads?

FILTERS:
- make existing filters support more useful colorspaces (YUV)
- colorspace conversion
- scaling (combine with conversion like mplayer?)
- (de)slicify
- decode order -> display order
- fifo buffer to buffer previous frames needed for next filter context
- spatial context providing filter
- picture-in-picture to test multiple inputs
- splitter, feeding a single input to multiple filters to test multiple outputs
- decimate to test non 1:1 input:output ratios
- naive temporal blur to test buffering of previous frames
- naive spatial blur to test spatial context
- decoder/encoder wrapper

- port vhook filters

PROGRAMS:
- make ffplay & ffmpeg support filters

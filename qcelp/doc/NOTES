How stuff works
---------------

The input speech is sampled at 8kHz. This speech is broken
down into 20ms speech codec frames, each consisting of 160
samples. The format synthesis (LPC) filter coefficients are
updated once per frame, regardless of the data rate selected.
The number of bits used to encode the LPC parameters is a
function of the selected rate (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8).


Parameters codes transmited for each rate packet (Page 25)
------------------------------------------------

LSPi     |  Line Spectral Pair frequency i.
LSPVi    |  Line Spectral Pair frequencies grouped into five R2 vectors.
PLAGi    |  Pitch Lag for the ith pitch subframe.
PFRACi   |  Fractional Pitch Lag for the ith pitch subframe.
PGAINi   |  Pitch Gain for the ith pitch subframe.
CBINDEXi |  Codebook Index for the ith codebook subframe.
CBGAINi  |  Unsigned Codebook Gain for the ith codebook subframe.
CBSEED   |  Random Seed for Rate 1/8 packets.
CBSIGNi  |  Sign of the Codebook Gain for the ith codebook subframe.


Bits for each rate packet (Page 26)
-------------------------

Rate 1   | 264 + 2 Reserved
Rate 1/2 | 124
Rate 1/4 | 52  + 2 Reserved
Rate 1/8 | 16  + 4 Reserved

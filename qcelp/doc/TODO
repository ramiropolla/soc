Clear:

- finish the codebook transmission code's conversion to gain, index and
  (when needed) cbseed (almost done).
- review rates 1 and 1/2 gain predictor calculations.
- review qcelp_compute_cdn().

Still somewhat fuzzy:

- Pitch synthesis filter.
- Pitch pre-filter.
- LSP freqs interpolation.
- Formant synthesis filter.
- Adaptive postfilter.
- Workability tests / Sample smashing
- Fixes (if needed :-)

End goals:

- Make it lighter
- Make it faster
- Celebrate

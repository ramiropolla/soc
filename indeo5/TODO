Please read my comments named "description" BEFORE doing anything! Thanks!

Some small steps needed to be completed in order to make FFmpeg able to decode indeo5 videos:

* split the 5/3 wavelet synthesis filter out of the snow source (see snow.c:spatial_compose53i) and adapt it to indeo5. The indeo5's high-pass coefficients must be upscaled by -2 in this case before those can be passed to that filter.

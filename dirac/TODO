- Compare the CABAC implementation to the Dirac spec
- Clean things up!!!
- Make sure the coding style is correct
- Fill in the missing bits

- Remove dprintfs, replace it with functions to dump the frame state
- Add doxygen comments for each function
- context_set_waveletcoeffs can be rewritten as code or split up
- Properly use bounded block reading
- Simplify sign predict
- Align assignments to make them prettier
- Properly store the amount of codeblocks per subband instead of using
  a fixed maximum of 7 subbands
- Remove the intra frame only hacks.
- Figure out how to reserve memory properly for coefficients in ffmpeg.
- IDWT!! :-)
- Eventually split up the file.

- Remove dprintfs, replace it with functions to dump the frame state
- context_set_waveletcoeffs can be rewritten as code or split up
- Properly store the amount of codeblocks per subband instead of using
  a fixed maximum of 7 subbands
- Global motion estimation has not been implemented yet, the reference
  implementations do not seem to support this yet.
- Update to the current specification, AFAIK the frame numbers are not
  stored anymore.
- Implement the low-delay syntax
- Implement support for interlacing
- Some wavelets that are not used in practise have not been
  implemented yet.

Optimizations:

- Perhaps a lookup table can be used for quantization factors
- Determine what's more efficient: memset all coefficients to 0, or
  just zero out the coefficients that need to be zero'ed out
- Use in place operations in IDWT, if that is possible
- Write IDWT in assembler
- Perhaps write arithmetic decoding in assembler
- Perhaps think about multithreading?
- For motion compensation the decoder loops over the pixels in the
  outer loop, like it described in the specification.  It is way more
  efficient to loop over the blocks.
- The halfpel interpolation code uses av_clip, this can be avoided.
- Merge the loops for halfpel interpolation.
- Just do the halfpel interpolation once when storing the reference
  frame instead of every time a reference frame is used.
- The code has not been profiled

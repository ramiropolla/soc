- Make sure the current code works to unpack inter frames
- Remove dprintfs, replace it with functions to dump the frame state
- context_set_waveletcoeffs can be rewritten as code or split up
- Properly store the amount of codeblocks per subband instead of using
  a fixed maximum of 7 subbands
- Unpack motion vectors

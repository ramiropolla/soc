- Make sure the current code works to unpack inter frames
- Remove dprintfs, replace it with functions to dump the frame state
- context_set_waveletcoeffs can be rewritten as code or split up
- Properly store the amount of codeblocks per subband instead of using
  a fixed maximum of 7 subbands
- Unpack motion vectors

Optimizations:

- Calculate the quantization factor just once per block instead of for
  each coefficient
- Perhaps a lookup table can be used for quantization factors
- Just malloc once in decode_intra_frame
- Determine what's more efficient: memset all coefficients to 0, or
  just zero out the coefficients that need to be zero'ed out
- Clipping in the IDWT might be very inefficient
- Use in place operations in IDWT, if that is possible
- y * padding_width is inefficient. Loop over y and add padding_width
- Make a special case for 1x1 codeblocks, perhaps merge the codeblock
  function into the subband function.
- coeff_posx and coeff_posy use *, can be avoided
- blockcnt != 1 in codeblock -> use addition instead of multiplication
- Write IDWT in assembler
- Perhaps write arithmetic decoding in assembler
- Perhaps think about multithreading?

Stuff that needs to be fixed (in order)

* Audible clicks are present with various content.

  Sample:

  ftp://samples.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/samples/A-codecs/AAC/zodiac_audio.mov

  'static' is heard in L & R channel. Good example happens exactly at 7,2 s.
  (Convert to wav with ffmpeg and load in audacity)

* Fix decent float2int conversion and downmixing

* Handle more channel orders

* Coupling channels are missing (copy in from soc/aac/)

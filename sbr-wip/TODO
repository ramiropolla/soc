This AAC SBR code is currently not functional and is merely a work-in-progress.
This document will be updated when it is functional. At the moment, the
following things need doing:

- Write single channel and channel pair sbr application functions as well as an
  apply_sbr() function
- Move variables to appropriate contexts and code blocks
- Use FFmpeg's dsputils for FFTs and other operations as appropriate
- Clean up the code
- More

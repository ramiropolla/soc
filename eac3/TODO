Enhanced AC-3 Decoder TODO List
-------------------------------

Features:

* Enhanced Coupling
    - We do not have a sample which uses enhanced coupling. I thought we
      had a sample, but it was just a bug in the decoder.

* Spectral Extension
    - We have one sample which uses spectral extension. I have implemented
      parsing of the spx data, but not the actual band replication. This
      allows for decoding, but results in a low cutoff frequency.

* Transient Pre-Noise Cross-Fading
    - We do have a sample which contains pre-noise data.

* Dependent Streams (more than 6 channels)
    - We do not currently have any samples which use dependent streams.

* Mixed AC-3 and E-AC-3
    - Blu-ray uses AC-3 for the independent stream, interleaved with
      E-AC-3 dependent stream(s) for extra channels.

* Adaptive Hybrid Transform (w/ GAQ and VQ)
    - Works for the 2 samples we have which utilize it.

* Reduced Sample Rates
    - E-AC-3 has the ability to use 1/2 sample rates
      (16kHz,22.05kHz,24kHz), but the specification does not say how to
      handle them (if at all) in the bit allocation. It is probably
      similar to RealAudio DolbyNet, but we need a sample to test.

Cosmetic:
* Add more useful comments and remove bad comments
* Add specification references

NOTE: Untested code for spectral extension and enhanced coupling can be
found in GSoC SVN revisions before r3012.

Enhanced AC-3 Decoder TODO List
-------------------------------

Features:

* Enhanced Coupling
    - We now have one sample which uses enhanced coupling, so testing
      and debugging can now be done.

* Spectral Extension
    - We do not currently have any samples which use spectral extension.

* Transient Pre-Noise Cross-Fading
    - We do have a sample which contains pre-noise data.

* Dependent Streams (more than 6 channels)
    - We do not currently have any samples which use dependent streams.

* Mixed AC3 and EAC3
    - Blu-ray uses AC3 for the independent stream, interleaved with
      E-AC3 dependent stream(s) for extra channels.

General:
* Use dither flags
* Merge decoding contexts for AC3 and E-AC3 decoders
* Remove duplicated code between AC3 and E-AC3 decoders
* Try to simplify and document AHT decoding
* Add raw E-AC3 format with proper extension and MIME type

Cosmetic:
* Continue renaming variables which are poorly named
* Add more useful comments and remove bad comments
* Add specification references
